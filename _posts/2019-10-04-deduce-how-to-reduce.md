title: 4 useless functions I wish JavaScript offered out of the box

  Map starting with the second element. Reduce a specific array interval. Get
  all indices of an element in an array.

JavaScript is a mess. There are countless articles on the web about how peculiar or counter intuitive some aspects of this language are. But as much as you may hate it, you have to admit it is a handy tool if you want to quickly build a small project, prove some code works, or simply have some fun. I use it a lot for solving algorithmic problems from websites such as HackerRank or ProjectEuler. 

But even if JavaScript is so widely and wildly used, sometimes it feels incomplete and forces you to break a function chain or implement a basic functionality from the ground up. Here are four functions that I wish were readily available in JavaScript.

## Array.distinct(selector)



## Array.indicesOf(test)



## Array.binarySearch(comparator)



## Number.rangeTo(toValue)
